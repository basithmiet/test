Yes, the <base href="/"> in your index.html could be causing the 404 Not Found error, especially if your application is not at the root of the IIS site.

Here’s what you should check and try:
	1.	Confirm URL Rewrite Module is Installed and Enabled
Ensure that the IIS Rewrite Module is correctly installed and enabled. You can check this in IIS Manager under Modules.
	2.	Check Rewrite Rules
	•	If you’re using a rewrite rule (e.g., for an SPA like Angular or React), ensure it correctly rewrites requests to index.html.
	•	A common rewrite rule for SPAs looks like this in web.config:

<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
      <rules>
        <rule name="Rewrite to index.html" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url=".*" />
          <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
            <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
            <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
          </conditions>
          <action type="Rewrite" url="/index.html" />
        </rule>
      </rules>
    </rewrite>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>


	3.	Adjust <base href="/">
	•	If your app is hosted in a subdirectory (e.g., http://example.com/myapp/), then <base href="/"> will cause incorrect routing.
	•	Change <base href="/"> to match your application path, e.g., <base href="/myapp/">.
	4.	Ensure Static File Serving is Enabled
	•	If index.html itself is not being found, check that Static Content is enabled in IIS Features.
	5.	Restart IIS
After making changes, restart IIS using:

iisreset



Try these steps and let me know if the issue persists.
